       Based on EXEC 2.7 (C)Barry Boone, Updated by Insane Multitasker

       Pinball is written by Rasmus Moustgaard

         PINROM256         v1.5 ROM from the /4A distribution; unchanged
         PINLOAD           Geneve native OS program; file loader
         PINBALL,M,N,O     Pinball program, modified for Geneve use

       Place all files in the same path.  Load as follows:

       PINLOAD PINBALL

       The file PINROM256 will automatically load from the same path as PINLOAD

       ROM banking simulation is achieved by using >4000-5FFF and Geneve memory
       map support. Keyboard routine is modified to support Geneve keyscan.

       Future release may simplify the loader requirements to eliminate the
       separate program image load.
